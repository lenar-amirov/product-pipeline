## Core Onboarding Principles

### Timeline-Based Structure

- **Month 1**: Role immersion and early wins
- **Month 3**: Full integration and feedback cycles

### Stakeholder Responsibility Matrix
- **HR/People Ops**: Compliance, benefits, company-wide orientation
- **IT/Security**: Equipment, access, security training
- **Direct Manager**: Role-specific training, goal setting, regular check-ins
- **Buddy/Mentor**: Cultural integration, informal support
- **Team Members**: Introductions, collaboration setup
